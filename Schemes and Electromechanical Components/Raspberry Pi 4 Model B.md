# Raspberry Pi 4 Model B:

- The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is a high-performance single-board computer (SBC) featuring a Broadcom BCM2711 quad-core Cortex-A72 processor clocked at 1.8GHz, our version in this project uses 2GB of LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM. It includes dual micro-HDMI ports for dual 4K display support, Gigabit Ethernet, Bluetooth 5.0, and dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz & 5.0GHz). The board offers two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 ports, a 40-pin GPIO header, and MIPI DSI/CSI interfaces for peripherals. The 40-pin GPIO header supports digital I/O, PWM, I2C, SPI, and UART, and it is commonly programmed using Python libraries like RPi.GPIO besides Scratch. The board is powered via USB-C (5V, 3A) and supports Power over Ethernet with an optional PoE HAT.

- In our project, this compact yet powerful device, powered by the USB Type-A converter module, serves as the central processing unit, executing and managing all computational commands essential for system operation. It precisely coordinates the wheel motors, enabling smooth and controlled mobility. Additionally, it interfaces with the camera, facilitating image processing and environmental awareness. Beyond these core functions, the device seamlessly integrates with various components, ensuring efficient communication and execution of all robotic commands. Its high-speed processing capabilities and multi-functional adaptability make it a crucial element in optimizing the robot's performance, responsiveness, and autonomous functionality.
