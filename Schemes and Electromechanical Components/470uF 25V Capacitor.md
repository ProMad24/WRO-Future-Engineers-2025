# 470uF 25V Capacitor:

To ensure stable power delivery in our robotic system, especially during motor startup and sudden load transitions, we incorporated a 470 µF / 25 V electrolytic capacitor across the motor driver’s supply rail. This capacitor serves as a local energy reservoir, discharging rapidly when the motor demands a surge of current. By doing so, it prevents voltage dips that could disrupt the operation of critical components such as the Raspberry Pi 4, the PiCamera v3, and the push button interface. We selected this specific capacitance and voltage rating to strike a balance between energy storage capacity and spatial efficiency within the robot’s enclosure. Its presence significantly reduces transient drops and electrical noise, helping us maintain consistent system behavior under dynamic operating conditions
