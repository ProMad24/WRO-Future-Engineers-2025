# WS2812B Assembly LED: **feedback component** // Push Button:

- The WS2812B assembly LED is a highly integrated, individually addressable RGB lighting solution that combines a 5050-sized SMD LED with an embedded control IC in a single package. This integration allows each LED to be controlled independently via a single-wire digital interface, significantly simplifying circuit design and reducing the number of required microcontroller pins. Operating within a 3.3V to 5V range, each LED can produce over 16 million colors by modulating the intensity of its red, green, and blue channels through 8-bit PWM control. The data signal propagates from one LED to the next, enabling seamless daisy-chaining of multiple units without complex wiring. This makes the WS2812B ideal for dynamic lighting applications, including status indicators, visual feedback systems, and aesthetic enhancements in embedded and robotic platforms.

In our robot, the WS2812B assembly LED functions as a dynamic visual feedback system, reflecting real-time sensor readings. It is powered via a regulated 5V line from the Mini 360 Buck Converter, with ground referenced to the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, and controlled through a GPIO pin using libraries like Adafruit NeoPixel. The LED color corresponds to environmental cues detected by the camera: when blue pixels are identified, the robot converts HSV data to RGB and displays blue; similarly, orange, red, green, and magenta are shown when their respective strips or pillars are recognized. This mapping allows quick visual confirmation of object detection and classification. Additionally, a default color is used to indicate the robotâ€™s idle or standby state, ensuring continuous status awareness during operation.
