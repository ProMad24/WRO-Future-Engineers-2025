# SG90 Servo Motor:

- The MG90s servo motor was specifically selected for this application due to its compact dimensions and its capacity for exceptionally precise angle management. Operating within a voltage range of 4.8V to 6V, it facilitates a full 180° rotation span, which is ideal for angular control tasks. Internally, its accurate motion is regulated by a sophisticated control circuit, which, coupled with a potentiometer for positional feedback, directs a DC motor and gear train. This regulation is achieved via Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals, where specific pulse durations within a 20ms cycle correspond to exact angles—a 1.5ms pulse for the center position, with 1ms and 2ms pulses for the opposing extremes.

- Furthermore, its performance capabilities are substantiated by a stall torque of approximately 1.8 kg-cm at 4.8V and a rapid response time of 0.10–0.12 seconds per 60° of rotation. The unit's lightweight design, high responsiveness, and seamless integration through a simple three-wire interface (power, ground, and signal) affirm its suitability for tasks demanding precise and dynamic motion control.
