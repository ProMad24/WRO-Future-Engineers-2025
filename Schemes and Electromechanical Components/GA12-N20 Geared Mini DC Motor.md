# GA12-N20 Geared Mini DC Motor:

The N20 DC 12V 150RPM gear motor was an ideal choice for this project. We selected this motor specifically for its power efficiency, compact size, and potent drive power, all of which were crucial to our robot's design. The motor's small dimensions were paramount, as they allowed for a streamlined and space-efficient build. Furthermore, the motor's high-torque output, which delivers a rated torque of approximately 2.5 kg-cm and a stall torque reaching nearly 8 kg-cm under heavy loads, provides the robust and responsive movement required for our system. A durable metal gearbox further enhances longevity and reduces wear over time. This motor's compact design, impressive torque efficiency, and robust construction made it a versatile and essential component for our technical application, ensuring reliable performance even in demanding conditions
