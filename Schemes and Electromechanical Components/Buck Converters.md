# Mini 360 DC-DC Buck Converter // DC-DC Buck Converter Module	with USB Type-A Output:

- The Mini 360 DC-DC Buck Converter is a compact and efficient voltage regulation module designed to step down higher DC voltages to a lower, adjustable output. Built around the MP2307 chip, it operates within an input range of 4.75V to 23V and delivers an output voltage adjustable between 1V and 17V. Despite its small size—just 17mm by 11mm—it supports a peak current of 3A and a continuous current of 1.8A, making it suitable for applications in robotics, DIY electronics, and embedded systems. In our robot, this module is specifically used to convert the 12V supplied by the batteries into a stable 5V output, which is essential for powering the servo motor and the assembly LED. Its high conversion efficiency, thermal shutdown protection, and onboard potentiometer for voltage tuning make it a reliable choice for compact power management.

- In contrast, the DC-DC Buck Converter Module with USB Type-A Output is tailored for powering USB devices directly from a higher voltage source. Typically supporting an input range of 6V to 24V, it steps down the voltage to a fixed 5V output via a standard USB Type-A port, delivering up to 3A of current. This module is ideal for charging smartphones, powering microcontrollers, or supplying regulated 5V to embedded systems. In our robot, it serves the critical function of converting the same 12V battery input into a suitable 5V output for the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, ensuring stable operation and protecting the board from voltage fluctuations. Its plug-and-play design, built-in protection features, and compatibility with common USB-powered devices make it especially useful in automotive, solar, and portable electronics applications.
