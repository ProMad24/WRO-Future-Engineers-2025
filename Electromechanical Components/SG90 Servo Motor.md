# SG90 Servo Motor:

- The SG90 servo motor is a compact and versatile micro servo, widely utilized in robotics and remote-control applications due to its precision and reliability. Operating within a voltage range of 4.8V to 6V, it provides a rotation span of 180°, making it ideal for angular control tasks. Internally, a DC motor drives a gear train, while an onboard control circuit, coupled with a potentiometer for position feedback, ensures accurate motion regulation via PWM signals. The PWM control mechanism utilizes pulses—1ms for one extreme, 1.5ms for the center, and 2ms for the opposite extreme—within a 20ms cycle, enabling precise angle adjustments. With a stall torque of approximately 1.8 kg-cm at 4.8V (increasing at 6V) and a rapid response time of 0.10–0.12 seconds per 60°, the SG90 is lightweight, highly responsive, and seamlessly integrates via its three-wire interface (power, ground, signal). Its efficient design and reliable performance make it an essential component for projects requiring precise and dynamic motion control.

- In our project, the steering mechanism is powered by this precision-controlled motor, responsible for adjusting the front wheels' orientation. Utilizing Lego structural components, including beams and a T-form Liftarm, the system ensures stable and responsive steering. The motor maintains linear alignment, allowing the robot to stay parallel to the mat’s walls for accurate navigation. When approaching a corner, it dynamically adjusts within a steering range of -45˚ to +45˚, ensuring smooth directional transitions. Additionally, this angular precision aids in obstacle avoidance and parking, allowing the system to navigate complex environments with enhanced accuracy. This servo-driven system enhances maneuverability, stability, and precise path correction, optimizing the robot’s overall performance.
