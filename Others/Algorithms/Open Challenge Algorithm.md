# Open Challenge: 

- To address the challenge, we developed a camera-based algorithm utilizing the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B alongside the Pi Camera Model 3. This system enables precise linear alignment, ensuring the robot maintains a consistent trajectory along the mat’s walls throughout the four straightforward sections. The steering mechanism is dynamically adjusted based on color recognition, allowing the robot to detect and respond to strip colors when encountering a corner. Additionally, the system incorporates a lap-counting function, enabling the robot to track its completed laps before executing a stop command. This integrated approach enhances autonomous navigation, spatial awareness, and real-time decision-making, optimizing the robot’s overall performance.

- To further elaborate on this mechanism, the following is a step-by-step breakdown of its functionality:

- Once the robot is placed on the mat, it initiates the program execution with a button press, activating its color detection system. The Pi Camera captures an image of the robot’s field of view, transmitting it to the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B for real-time processing. Within the straightforward sections, the system performs pixel density analysis, calculating the number of black pixels on both the right and left sides, which correspond to the mat’s walls. Subsequently, it determines the ratio between these values, enabling precise steering adjustments. The control algorithm ensures the robot remains aligned with the walls. This integrated approach enhances environmental awareness, autonomous correction, and trajectory stability, optimizing the robot’s overall performance in linear path segments.

- Within the corner sections, the system utilizes the same color-based navigation algorithm to determine the steering direction. Upon detecting the initial strip at a corner, the robot analyzes its color to establish the appropriate turning orientation: an orange strip signals a clockwise turn, whereas a blue strip denotes a counterclockwise turn. Once the steering direction is determined, the system transitions to line tracking, disregarding any further color inputs. Upon encountering a strip within the corner section, the robot executes a precise 45˚ turn, the direction of which depends on the previously determined orientation—applying a positive 45˚ rotation for clockwise turns and a negative 45˚ rotation for counterclockwise turns. This approach guarantees smooth and accurate directional changes. A servo motor facilitates these steering adjustments by delivering precise angular displacement, thereby optimizing the robot’s maneuverability. Collectively, this integrated strategy enhances cornering precision, maintains trajectory stability, and significantly improves the efficiency of autonomous navigation.

- Upon completing its laps around the mat, the robot executes a predefined stopping sequence. The Pi Camera continuously detects corner strips, determining when the robot should initiate steering adjustments. Simultaneously, the system employs a lap-tracking algorithm, incrementing a counter each time a line is detected. Once the robot registers 12 detections, confirming the completion of three full laps, it initiates a time-based delay before executing a final stop command. This sensor-driven termination mechanism ensures precise lap tracking, controlled stopping, and seamless challenge completion, optimizing the robot’s overall performance.
