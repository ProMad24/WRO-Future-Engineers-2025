# Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3:

- The Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 is a state-of-the-art imaging solution designed for seamless integration with Raspberry Pi devices. Equipped with a 12MP Sony IMX708 sensor, it provides autofocus, HDR capability, and enhanced low-light performance, ensuring exceptional image clarity across various applications. Available in standard and wide-angle configurations, as well as NoIR variants for infrared imaging, it offers versatile functionality. With full HD video recording at 50fps, it integrates effortlessly into Raspberry Piâ€™s open-source camera ecosystem, making it an indispensable tool for photography, live streaming, and AI-driven image processing, thereby pushing creative and technical boundaries.

- In our project, the Pi Camera plays a crucial role in visual data acquisition and object recognition. It detects black pixels, which represent the walls of the mat, ensuring accurate environmental mapping. Additionally, it identifies orange and blue pixels, marking the four corner lines for precise spatial localization. The camera further recognizes red and green pixels, signifying obstacle pillars, enabling effective navigation and collision avoidance. Moreover, it detects pink pixels, which represent the walls of the parking lot, allowing for structured positioning within the designated area. Once the visual data is captured, the Pi Camera transmits these signals to the Raspberry Pi, where computational algorithms process the information for real-time analysis and decision-making. This integrated system enhances object detection, spatial awareness, and autonomous control, ensuring optimal performance in dynamic environments.
