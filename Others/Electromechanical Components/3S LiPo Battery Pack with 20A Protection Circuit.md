# 3S LiPo Battery Pack with 20A Protection Circuit: 

The 3S Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery pack consists of three cells in series, delivering a nominal voltage of 11.1V and a maximum of 12.6V when fully charged. It features an integrated 20A Battery Management System (BMS) that protects against overcharging, deep discharging, and short circuits, ensuring safe and reliable power delivery.

Thanks to its lightweight pouch construction, the LiPo pack offers flexibility and compactness, which are especially advantageous in robotic applications. Its ability to provide high discharge rates with minimal voltage drop makes it ideal for systems demanding bursts of power. Due to its excellent energy density, thermal stability, and protective features, this pack serves as the primary power source for our robot, enabling efficient, high-performance operation
