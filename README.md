# Introdution :
In pursuit of comfort, humans have always sought easier ways of travel, one example being the self-driving car. An “autonomous” car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement. Driven by curiosity, humanity has reached the necessary technological advancements to achieve a truly autonomous car. Thus, in our project we strive to design, then build a car that is able to move independently while making optimal decisions. Moreover, we extend this work to incorporate obstacle avoidance. In order to achieve our objectives, we developed an integrated system using a Raspberry Pi Model B, which receives and processes information to make decisions before transmitting signals to execute specific commands.
