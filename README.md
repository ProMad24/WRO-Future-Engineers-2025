# Introdution :
In pursuit of comfort, humans have always sought easier ways of travel, one example being the self-driving car. An ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement. Driven by curiosity, humanity has reached the necessary technological advancements to achieve a truly autonomous car. Thus, in our project we strive to design, then build a car that is able to move independently while making optimal decisions. Moreover, we extend this work to incorporate obstacle avoidance. In order to achieve our objectives, we developed an integrated system using a Raspberry Pi Model B, which receives and processes information to make decisions before transmitting signals to execute specific commands.

Our approach to the competition was structured into two parts, each addressing a specific challenge. However, both solutions relied on a shared core mechanism: a color-based navigation system.

To inform readers about the vehicle's design, we outline its electromechanical components in the following list:
1)	Raspberry Pi 4 Model B: This single-board computer (SBC) acts as the central processing unit of the vehicle, handling image analysis and motor control to ensure precise navigation.
2)	PiCamera Module 3: A camera designed for the Raspberry Pi, enabling image alongside video capture before transmitting data to the board for processing.
3)	G12-N20 Geared Mini DC Motor: A compact yet powerful motor that enables forward and reverse rotation of the vehicle‚Äôs rear wheels.
4)	SG90 Servo Motor: With its precise angular rotation, this servo motor is essential for steering the vehicle‚Äôs front wheels, ensuring accurate directional control.
5)	Addressable RGB LED: This LED acts as a real-time debugger for the vehicle, changing colors based on its signals and commands to provide immediate visual feedback.
